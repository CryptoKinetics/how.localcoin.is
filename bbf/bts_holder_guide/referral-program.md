## Referral Program

The BitShares Blockchain has an integrated one-level referral system. Basically, everyone interacting on the BitShares blockchain needs to pay a *transaction fee*. From that fee (currently) 20% go into the Working Budget (for future funding of development etc.) and the other 80% go into the referral program from where, the registrar (who paid and assisted the registration process) as well as the referrer (who brought the user to the registrar) receive a cashback. 

To opt-out of the referral program, an account can be upgraded to a so called **Life-Time Member (LTM)** which replaces registrar and referrer for the original user to receive a 80% cashback on his fees
