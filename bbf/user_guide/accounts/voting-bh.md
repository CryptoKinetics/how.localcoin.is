Voting is important in Bitshares in the same way it is important to the community in which you live. The weight of your vote is directly correlated to the number of BTS you own. If you aren't heavily involved in the community, you are encouraged to choose a proxy who represents your interests.

If you hold some BTS tokens, you are considered a BTS holder of the BitShares business and thus have a say in where it should be heading in future. As a BTS holder you can cast a vote for three different entities within the network:

#### Witnesses

Witnesses(Block producers) are entities that work for the blockchain by constructing new blocks. Their role is similar to the role of miners for Bitcoin and other blockchains. Each witness is approved by the BTS holders and constructs and signs blocks from validated transactions. Every transaction made in the network is required to be validated by all witnesses.

*Consensus Mechanism:* Who exactly is allowed to produce a block at which time instant is defined by a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake. In essence, you, the BTS holders can cast a vote for your preferred block producers on the blockchain. Those witnesses with the most votes are allowed to produce blocks.

#### Committee Members

The committee is a set of entities that are approved by the BTS holders and set policy for the Bitshares blockchain including:

- Transaction and trading fees
- Blockchain parameters, such as block size, block interval
- Referral and vesting parameters such as cash back percentage and vesting periods

#### Workers

Workers are proposals to perform a service in return for a salary from the blockchain. A worker proposal contains at a minimum the following information:

- A start and end date
- A daily pay
- A maximum total pay
- A link to a webpage where the worker proposal is explained

*Worker Lifecycle*

|           |                                                                                                 |
|----|----|
| Proposed  | These worker proposals have been submitted to the blockchain and are being actively voted on.  <br/>  In order to become active, they must exceed the refund400k worker in total votes.               |
| Active    | These worker proposals have exceeded the threshold and are being actively paid. Active workers   can be defunded if their vote threshold is reduced below the refund400k worker level.           |
| Expired   | These worker proposals are displayed for historical purposes. You will find proposals that  have ended based upon their end date.                                     |


#### Proxy
	
You may choose to not be active in the governance of Bitshares. If this is the case, it's important that you choose someone in the Bitshares community who you identify with and set that entity as your **proxy**. This gives them to the power to vote on your behalf with your BTS shares backing their vote. This is similar to electing a representative.
